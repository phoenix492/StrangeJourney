# Rejected.
Some mods don't fit. Some I personally dislike. Some just aren't very good. None of those will be going in my modpack.

## Negotiable/Potential Future
- Veinminer, FTB Ultimine, OreExcavator, Similar: Makes it too easy to shred through the world and get all the resources you would ever need. No need to set up a miner or explore caves when you can just take chunks out of the ground and get everything you need. I would be willing to include this with a pretty agressive blacklist/whitelist to make sure it's only used for ores. 
- Apotheosis: Extremely overtuned defaults. Makes players extremely allpowerful gods. All other mods must be balanced around its extremely large numbers. It's data driven so if its defaults were to be ripped out and entirely replaced with a different system, then maybe? But I'm not gonna do that. Someone else can and I'll think about including it.
- Incendium, Terralith, Nullscape: Interesting mods but overwhelming. Terralith in particular is being considered for a separate dimension. 
- Ad Astra: Ultimately, disappoints me that I feel the need to choose to do this. I love space mods as a logistical challenge (making breathable bases, transport, etc) and as a natural goal, but Ad Astra 1) simplified the space program process so much it’s no longer really a challenge to get there and 2) does not have anything to justify this simplification, as its planets and moons are barren and uninteresting. The point of a space mod is that logistical challenge, and Ad Astra is basically a space themed empty dimension mod.
- Shoulder Surfing Reloaded: This made me weirdly motion sick. Also most people are used to vanilla behavior and deviating too far is disruptive.
- Dungeons Mobs: Rejected on initial look as being overwhelming. Open to revisiting.
- Create Copycats+: Framed Blocks chosen for now, but I'm willing to revist this and use Copycats+ instead. 
- Parcool: Considered for rewards tied to Slice of Life. Rejected due to the fact that it just generally seems low configurability especially in the "granting powers over time" department.
- Biomes O Plenty: Too much for the overworld. Under consideration for inclusion in alternate dimension.

## Non-Negotiable
- MCreator Mods: Performance implications. Mods that exclsuively add items such as Farmers Delight compat are worth considering. 
- Mystical Agriculture: Free resources from a unified and all together boring source. Other wackier and more interesting specialized farm designs are entirely invalidated and completely useless. The presence of this mod in ATM9 was one of the original reasons for the genesis of this modpack.
- Productive Bees: Same reasons as Mystical Agriculture but gets a special mention to say fuck LobsterJohn.
- Waystones: Free, instant, cheap to produce, and simple to set up teleportation makes worlds feel smaller and both exploring and transportation infrastructure less rewarding.
- Extreme Reactors: Over-tuned, “be all end all” power production method. Obsoletes other power generation methods.
- Refined Storage: Too easy to set up, too simple to expand. AE2 and even other quirky storage systems are often ignored in favor of agressively scaling RS systems upwards.
- Iron Furnaces: Uninteresting. Simple but powerful. Honestly rather tacky.
- Powah: Boring identical tiered power production. 
- Pipez: Apocalyptically laggy. Boring.
- Easy Villagers: Removes gameplay and build present even in vanilla in favor of single block pipe-in-pipe-out solutions. 
- AllTheCompressed, Other Similar: Encourages degenerate storage gameplay on top of item+recipe bloat. 
- Mythic Botany: Directly opposed to Botania's vision. Strange and uninteresting.
- More Villagers: Appears to just replace exploring with villager trading.
- Twigs: Item clutter. Dislike the sounds of blocks. Decoration not nice enough to work around or tolerate these issues.
- Project Red: Opted for More Red, Project Red is rather bloated and it's dependency on CBMultipart is dreadful.
- Minecolonies: Poor behavior from developers on github issue.
- Cyclic: Just misses quality standards.
- Create Dreams & Desires: Doesn't work on 1.20.1 w/ Create 6. Was unfinshed and lacking in features on this version anyway due to ongoing rewrite.
