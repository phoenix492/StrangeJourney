## Loot Options
What makes a good loot item to populate shops and loot tables is that it's 1) a commodity that you always want and that hording feels good 2) not a farmable resource 3) not something the player has to ordinarily work hard for. (1 can be ignored if it's been made exclusively obtainable through said loot methods, like Plushies will be through gacha rolls)
- Cobblemon: CobGyms keys, Relic Coins, XP Candy
- Gacha Rolls: Plushies, Hats, IE Shader Grab-bags, Trading Card boosters
## Loot Addendum: Paraglider Heart Containers and Stamina
Paraglider's player upgrades are special in that they directly violate 1 by being turned into NOT a commodity. In essence, though they're all technically the same item, each Heart Container is given once for a specific event (the first time killing a boss). Stamina vessels are unimplemented but they'll likely be given out for visitng important structures, biomes, and dimensions (an exploration reward).
