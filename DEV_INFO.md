## Loot Options
What makes a good loot item to populate shops and loot tables is that it's 1) a commodity that you always want and that hording feels good 2) not a farmable resource 3) not something the player has to ordinarily work hard for. (1 can be ignored if it's been made exclusively obtainable through said loot methods, like Plushies will be through gacha rolls)
- Cobblemon: CobGyms keys, Relic Coins, XP Candy
- Gacha Rolls: Plushies, Hats, IE Shader Grab-bags, Trading Card boosters
